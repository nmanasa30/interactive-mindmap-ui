# Interactive Mindmap UI

An interactive, data-driven mindmap UI built with React. The application visualizes hierarchical data as a mindmap with zooming, panning, and clear parent–child relationships. The entire UI is generated from a structured JSON file—updating the data updates the visualization without changing UI logic.
